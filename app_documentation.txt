# Student Study Manager - Detailed Documentation
==================================================

Developed by Chenoufi Abderrahmane
Version: 2.0 Beta

1. Overview
-----------
The Student Study Manager is a cross-platform desktop application built with Python and PyQt5. It provides a centralized hub for university students to organize their curriculum, track progress, manage study time using the Pomodoro technique, and analyze their performance over time.

2. Architecture and Technology Stack
------------------------------------
- Language: Python 3.x
- GUI Framework: PyQt5 (Signals, Slots, QStackedWidget, QPainter for custom UI)
- Database: SQLite (Embedded, no external server required)
- Audio: Pygame Mixer (Handles multiple sound channels for effects and background music)
- Styles: Custom QSS (Qt Style Sheets) with Light/Dark mode support.
- Config: JSON-based configuration for persistence of user preferences (language, theme, database path).

3. Core Data Model (SQLite Schema)
----------------------------------
- Semesters: Organizes subjects into academic periods.
- Subjects: Stores subject names, exam dates, test dates, and custom notes.
- Chapters: Breaks subjects into smaller units with "Video" and "Exercises" sub-tasks. Now supports specific "due_date".
- Study Sessions: Logs every study interval with subject ID, duration (minutes), and timestamp for analytics.
- User Profile: Tracks XP, Level, and Total Sessions for the gamification system.

4. Functional Modules
---------------------

A. Dashboard (The Command Center)
- Overall Progress: Calculates the percentage of completed sub-tasks across all chapters.
- Next Exam: Displays a countdown to the nearest exam date.
- Study Streak: A dynamic counter that increments for every consecutive day a study session is logged.
- To-Do List: Shows the next 5 actionable tasks from any subject.
- Progress Overview: Visual progress bar for overall course completion.

B. Study Planner
- Semester Management: Users can create and switch between different semesters.
- Subject Management: Add, delete, and view subjects within the selected semester.
- Quick View: View chapter completion status and notes for the selected subject.
- Subject Window: A dedicated pop-up for deep-diving into a subject, managing its chapters, due dates, and rich text notes.

C. Pomodoro Timer
- Configurable Intervals: Work, short break, and long break times can be adjusted in settings.
- Circular Progress: A custom-painted widget that visually represents time remaining.
- Task Suggestion: Uses an algorithm to suggest which specific chapter and task (Video or Exercise) to focus on next.
- Gamification: Awards 50 XP upon completion of a work session. Leveling up triggers sound effects.
- Lo-Fi Music: Integrates a focus music player with multiple tracks (Lo-Fi, Rain, Nature).

D. Analytics Explorer
- Session Distribution: A pie chart showing which subjects consume the most study time.
- Semester Comparison: A bar chart comparing productivity across academic periods.
- Daily Progress: Line chart tracking total study minutes over the last 7 days.
- Weekly Trends: Visualizes long-term consistency over the last 8 weeks.

E. Settings and Customization
- Localization: Supports English, Arabic (RTL), and French.
- Theme: Toggle between Light and Dark mode with instant stylesheet swapping.
- Database Management: Allows users to move or change the location of the `student_data.db` file (useful for cloud sync).
- Pomodoro Config: Interface to set custom minute intervals for study/break cycles.

5. Intelligent Systems
----------------------

A. Streak Logic
The streak is calculated on-the-fly by querying unique dates from the `study_sessions` table. If the most recent study date is older than yesterday, the streak resets to zero.

B. Desktop Notifications
Using `QSystemTrayIcon`, the app sends native system notifications for:
- Pomodoro session completion (Work/Break).
- Upcoming exams (within 3 days).
- Upcoming chapter deadlines (within 3 days).

C. Smart Progress Tracking
Each chapter is considered 50% done if the "Video" is watched, and 100% done only when "Exercises" are also completed. This reflects a realistic study workflow.

6. File Structure (Key Files)
-----------------------------
- run.py: Application entry point.
- config.json: Stores user settings.
- student_data.db: The database file.
- student_app/database.py: Contains all SQL queries and data logic.
- student_app/sound_manager.py: Manages audio playback and Lo-Fi loop.
- student_app/ui/styles.py: The "Theme Engine" of the app.
- student_app/ui/translations.py: The dictionary for multi-language support.

7. Future Roadmap
-----------------
- Cloud synchronization via API.
- Exporting analytics to PDF/CSV.
- Interactive calendar view for deadlines.
- More granular sub-task management.
